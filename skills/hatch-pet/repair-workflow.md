## Repair Workflow

If frame inspection or final visual QA fails, read `qa/review.json`, regenerate the smallest failing row, copy the replacement row into the same decoded output path, and keep that job marked complete with the new `source_path` and `completed_at`. Repair the failed row, not the whole sheet.
